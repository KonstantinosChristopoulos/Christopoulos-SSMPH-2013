This repository contains the code (“R code” folder) and data (“Data” folder) for the SSM Population Health publication “Associations between lockdown intensity and suicide mortality in US states” doi: 

The analysis is divided into 3 parts: total, by gender, and by race. Due to CDC’s data confidentiality restrictions, for the racial analysis, only data for whites can be made publicly available. Nevertheless, the code is supplied for all races. The file ‘maps.r’ provides code and data to reproduce Figure 1. 

To replicate the results you will need to install the R package ‘rethinking’. The process can take some time and effort—more than the usual install.packages() procedure. The following link provides assistance https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking (scroll down to Installation). The package offers a lot and in my opinion it is worth the time and effort. 

Acknowledgments: All these would not be possible if it weren’t  for the research revolutionary and open science propagator, Dr. Richard McElreath. I thank Richard for changing my research life and I encourage you to read his revolutionary book “Statistical Rethinking” and try to follow his ways the best you can.
